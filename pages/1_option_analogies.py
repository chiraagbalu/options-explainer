st.write("""### What's an Option?

Options are kind of like coupons. 

Let’s say Nike is selling coupons for a pair of basketball shoes, at **10 dollars per coupon**. 

Each coupon will let you buy **2 pairs of LeBron shoes** for **200 dollars each**. 

The coupons **expire in 1 month**, so you have some time to decide to use the coupon. 

These coupons have:
- **a price** (you have to pay money for the coupon)
- **a way to transact** (you get to buy something for a specified price)
- **an underlying asset** (you get to buy a pair of LeBrons)
- **an expiry date** (you get to buy a pair of LeBrons until 1 month from now)
- **a price to transact at** (you get to buy a pair LeBrons at 200 dollars until 1 month from now)
- **a quantity** (you get to buy 2 pairs of LeBrons at 200 dollars each until 1 month from now)

You decide to buy some coupons

How do we know how much these coupons are worth? 

If a pair of Lebrons cost 190 dollars each right now, do you really want to use the coupon? Probably not, since you can just buy the shoes from Nike instead. So the coupon likely isn’t worth much. 

But let’s say LeBron wins the finals with the Lakers next week (hypothetically). Suddenly, the LeBrons are flying off the shelves, and Nike jacks up the prices to 300 dollars a pair!

How are we feeling? Pretty good I’d imagine! We can buy each pair of LeBrons for 100 dollars off the retail price.

Since we expect there's a lot of people willing to buy the shoe, we might even buy the 2 pairs of shoes for 200 dollars each, and sell them to someone else for 300 dollars each. 
This means we'd make 190 dollars! 

Can you see why?

So if we know the coupon is expiring today, we can pretty easily plot out the profit we might get from the using the coupon, as a function of Nike's retail price.

This is pretty cool! Looks like we have a ton of upside (potentially infinite), and not very much downside (what we paid for the coupon, 10 dollars). 

Play around with the parameters a bit, try to answer the following questions/do the following:

TODO: make simulations load faster, whole page reloads whenever you change a parameter so i would like to isolate that somehow

TODO: make these exploration questions better lol

- what happens when the coupon price is above the maximum of the price range?
- what happens when the coupon price is below the minimum of the price range?
- what's the relation between the price paid for the coupon, coupon price, and the min/max price range?

### Another Kind of Option

Now that we've done some exploration, let's talk about another variant of an option. 

Imagine instead of being able to buy an object for a specified price before some specified expiration date, we can sell an object instead. 

For example, imagine you have a designer handbag that a coworker of yours has always wanted. 

She's saving up for her own bag, but she's willing to buy your bag off of you anytime within the next year, for 1500 dollars. 
She'll guarantee to do this trade with you, if you pay her 100 dollars up front. 

Like before, this deal has:
- **a price** (you have to pay money to guarantee the deal)
- **a way to transact** (you get to sell something for a specified price)
- **an underlying asset** (you get to sell your handbag)
- **an expiry date** (you get to sell handbags until 1 year from now)
- **a price to transact at** (you get to sell handbags at 1500 dollars until 1 year from now)
- **a quantity** (you get to buy 1 handbag at 1500 dollars each until 1 year from now)

The handbag is worth 2000 dollars right now, so you have no reason to sell it to her for 1500 dollars. 
But like before with the LeBron shoes - something might happen that could cause your handbag's value to drop dramatically. 

Let's say you agree to her deal. 

A few months later, handbags are falling out of fashion. In a shocking twist, backpacks have become all the rage, and the one-sided handbags are seen as trashy. 
Your handbag is only worth 200 dollars now! (it is still very high quality)

You call your coworker and give her the handbag. She's a bit upset, but upholds her end of the bargain. 

How much money did you just make, in theory? 
You sold something that was worth 200 dollars for 1500 dollars, and you only paid 100 dollars to be able to do that, so you've made 1200 dollars!

Generalizing this formula:
""")

st.write(""" Just like before, we can plot the theoretical profit we'd have had one year out, depending on how much our handbag ended up being worth.

Notice again that when the handbag is worth anything more than 1500 dollars, we simply don't sell it to our coworker - since we'd just be losing money.

### What does this have to do with options?

What we've just described here **are** options!

Options come in two types, **Calls** and **Puts**.

Like with the Nike Coupons, Call Options allow you to buy a fixed amount of some asset (for example, stocks), at a specified price until an expiration date.

And like with the Coworker Handbag Deal, Put Options allow you to sell a fixed amount of some asset (for example, stocks), at a specified price until an expiration date.

They're called 'options' because you don't have to exercise them! 

If the LeBrons had never increased in price, we wouldn't want or need to use them, so all we'd lose is the amount we paid for the coupon.

Same situation for the handbag, we didn't exercise the option to sell it to our coworker because it wouldn't be profitable for us.

Before we move on, let's quickly go over some terminology, so that everyone is on the same page. 

### Terminology

- The specified price that we transact at in an option is its **STRIKE PRICE**

- The price that we pay for an option is its **PREMIUM**

- The amount of the asset that we trade in an option is its **MULTIPLIER** (stock options are usually 100)

- The expiration date is the ... **EXPIRATION DATE** (no fancy name here)

We can describe an option by using the following structure

{Asset} {Expiration Date or Days to Expiry} {Strike Price} {Call/Put} @ {Premium}

Think about what the options we talked about earlier might be described as

LeBron 30DTE 200c @ 10 dollars

Handbag 365DTE 1500p @ 100 dollars
