Options are kind of like coupons. 

Let’s say Nike is selling coupons for a pair of basketball shoes, at **10 dollars per coupon**. 

Each coupon will let you buy **2 pairs of LeBron shoes** for **200 dollars each**. 

The coupons **expire in 1 month**, so you have some time to decide to use the coupon. 

These coupons have:
- **a price** (you have to pay money for the coupon)
- **a way to transact** (you get to buy something for a specified price)
- **an underlying asset** (you get to buy a pair of LeBrons)
- **an expiry date** (you get to buy a pair of LeBrons until 1 month from now)
- **a price to transact at** (you get to buy a pair LeBrons at 200 dollars until 1 month from now)
- **a quantity** (you get to buy 2 pairs of LeBrons at 200 dollars each until 1 month from now)

You decide to buy some coupons

How do we know how much these coupons are worth? 

If a pair of Lebrons cost 190 dollars each right now, do you really want to use the coupon? Probably not, since you can just buy the shoes from Nike instead. So the coupon likely isn’t worth much. 

But let’s say LeBron wins the finals with the Lakers next week (hypothetically). Suddenly, the LeBrons are flying off the shelves, and Nike jacks up the prices to 300 dollars a pair!

How are we feeling? Pretty good I’d imagine! We can buy each pair of LeBrons for 100 dollars off the retail price.

Since we expect there's a lot of people willing to buy the shoe, we might even buy the 2 pairs of shoes for 200 dollars each, and sell them to someone else for 300 dollars each. 
This means we'd make 190 dollars! 

Can you see why?

st.latex('''(300-200) \\times 2 - 10 = 100 \\times 2 - 10 = 200 - 10 = 190''')

st.write("""
Generalizing this formula:
""")

st.latex('''(\\text{Nike Price} - \\text{Discounted Price}) \\times (n \\text{ pairs of shoes per coupon}) - (\\text{coupon price})''')


st.write("""
So if we know the coupon is expiring today, we can pretty easily plot out the profit we might get from the using the coupon, as a function of Nike's retail price.

Notice that when the shoes are worth anything less than 200 dollars, we simply don't use our coupon - since we'd just be losing money.

This is pretty cool! Looks like we have a ton of upside (potentially infinite), and not very much downside (what we paid for the coupon, 10 dollars). 

Play around with the parameters a bit, try to answer the following questions/do the following:

TODO: make simulations load faster, whole page reloads whenever you change a parameter so i would like to isolate that somehow

TODO: make these exploration questions better lol

- what happens when the coupon price is above the maximum of the price range?
- what happens when the coupon price is below the minimum of the price range?
- what's the relation between the price paid for the coupon, coupon price, and the min/max price range?
