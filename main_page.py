st.write("""## Key Idea of Options

Options let us express beliefs on how wiggly the price of a stock is (also known as its 'volatility')

### What's an Option?

Options are kind of like coupons. 

Let’s say Nike is selling coupons for a pair of basketball shoes, at **10 dollars per coupon**. 

Each coupon will let you buy **2 pairs of LeBron shoes** for **200 dollars each**. 

The coupons **expire in 1 month**, so you have some time to decide to use the coupon. 

These coupons have:
- **a price** (you have to pay money for the coupon)
- **a way to transact** (you get to buy something for a specified price)
- **an underlying asset** (you get to buy a pair of LeBrons)
- **an expiry date** (you get to buy a pair of LeBrons until 1 month from now)
- **a price to transact at** (you get to buy a pair LeBrons at 200 dollars until 1 month from now)
- **a quantity** (you get to buy 2 pairs of LeBrons at 200 dollars each until 1 month from now)

You decide to buy some coupons

How do we know how much these coupons are worth? 

If a pair of Lebrons cost 190 dollars each right now, do you really want to use the coupon? Probably not, since you can just buy the shoes from Nike instead. So the coupon likely isn’t worth much. 

But let’s say LeBron wins the finals with the Lakers next week (hypothetically). Suddenly, the LeBrons are flying off the shelves, and Nike jacks up the prices to 300 dollars a pair!

How are we feeling? Pretty good I’d imagine! We can buy each pair of LeBrons for 100 dollars off the retail price.

Since we expect there's a lot of people willing to buy the shoe, we might even buy the 2 pairs of shoes for 200 dollars each, and sell them to someone else for 300 dollars each. 
This means we'd make 190 dollars! 

Can you see why?

st.latex('''(\\text{Nike Price} - \\text{Discounted Price}) \\times (n \\text{ pairs of shoes per coupon}) - (\\text{coupon price})''')


st.write("""
So if we know the coupon is expiring today, we can pretty easily plot out the profit we might get from the using the coupon, as a function of Nike's retail price.

Notice that when the shoes are worth anything less than 200 dollars, we simply don't use our coupon - since we'd just be losing money.

### Another Kind of Option

Now that we've done some exploration, let's talk about another variant of an option. 

Imagine instead of being able to buy an object for a specified price before some specified expiration date, we can sell an object instead. 

For example, imagine you have a designer handbag that a coworker of yours has always wanted. 

She's saving up for her own bag, but she's willing to buy your bag off of you anytime within the next year, for 1500 dollars. 
She'll guarantee to do this trade with you, if you pay her 100 dollars up front. 

Like before, this deal has:
- **a price** (you have to pay money to guarantee the deal)
- **a way to transact** (you get to sell something for a specified price)
- **an underlying asset** (you get to sell your handbag)
- **an expiry date** (you get to sell handbags until 1 year from now)
- **a price to transact at** (you get to sell handbags at 1500 dollars until 1 year from now)
- **a quantity** (you get to buy 1 handbag at 1500 dollars each until 1 year from now)

The handbag is worth 2000 dollars right now, so you have no reason to sell it to her for 1500 dollars. 
But like before with the LeBron shoes - something might happen that could cause your handbag's value to drop dramatically. 

Let's say you agree to her deal. 

A few months later, handbags are falling out of fashion. In a shocking twist, backpacks have become all the rage, and the one-sided handbags are seen as trashy. 
Your handbag is only worth 200 dollars now! (it is still very high quality)

You call your coworker and give her the handbag. She's a bit upset, but upholds her end of the bargain. 

How much money did you just make, in theory? 
You sold something that was worth 200 dollars for 1500 dollars, and you only paid 100 dollars to be able to do that, so you've made 1200 dollars!

### What does this have to do with options?

What we've just described here **are** options!

Options come in two types, **Calls** and **Puts**.

Like with the Nike Coupons, Call Options allow you to buy a fixed amount of some asset (for example, stocks), at a specified price until an expiration date.

And like with the Coworker Handbag Deal, Put Options allow you to sell a fixed amount of some asset (for example, stocks), at a specified price until an expiration date.

They're called 'options' because you don't have to do them! If the LeBrons had never increased in price, all we lose is the amount we paid for the option, same situation for the handbag. 

### Terminology

Let's quickly go over some terminology, so that everyone is on the same page. 

- The specified price that we transact at in an option is its **STRIKE PRICE**

- The price that we pay for an option is its **PREMIUM**

- The amount of the asset that we trade in an option is its **MULTIPLIER**

- The expiration date is the ... **EXPIRATION DATE** (no fancy name here)

We can describe an option by using the following structure

{Asset} {Expiration Date or Days to Expiry} {Strike Price} {Call/Put} @ {Premium}

Think about what the options we talked about earlier might be described as

LeBron 30DTE 200c @ 10 dollars

Handbag 365DTE 1500p @ 100 dollars

### How much should options cost?

What does any of this have to do with the key idea of volatility? 

It mostly comes from how we price these options.

Let's use a very simple underlying asset to start with: a die.

I'm going to roll the die, and the value of the die will be the amount of dots on the face-up side of the die. 

So if the die comes up 6, the asset is worth 6 dollars. 

You can assume the die is fair, so there's an equal chance that each face comes up on top.

How much should the 4 dollar strike be worth (or what is its premium)? Let's say that the multiplier is 1 (just one die) and that the expiration is after the dice is rolled, and its price is determined. 

We'll start by randomly guessing and vibing out some basic ideas. 

Pretend it's worth 1 cent. Seems a bit cheap, right? We could buy it for a cent a bunch of times, and expect to make more than a cent most of the time - so that's probably too cheap. (Why?)

What if it's worth 2 dollars?
That seems a bit high, we could sell it to someone at that price a bunch of times and expect to make money almost every time, since it's never going to pay out more than 2 dollars. (Why?) 

So the answer is somewhere in between these bounds. 

We can try to figure out how much the option is worth by simulating the dice roll a bunch of times, and finding the average value of the option over time.

Let's roll a dice 100,000 times, and plot a histogram of the rolls that we get

Now we can calculate the average price of the option over the 100,000 rolls, and that should be pretty close to what the option is actually worth!

This is pretty much how options are priced in the real world, on just about any asset!

1. Come up with a distribution of the possible prices of the asset on the day of the expiry.
2. Estimate or simulate the probability that each price happens
3. Figure out how much the option is worth for each price
4. Find the average value of the option based on the probability distribution of prices

Here, we 
1. Came up with the distribution of possible prices (1-6 are the possible faces of a die)
2. Estimated the probability of each possible price by simulating (roughly 1/6 since it's a fair die)
3. Figured out how much the option is worth for each price (Die Value - Strike Price whenever the Die Value > Strike Price)
4. Found the average value of the option based on the probability distribution of prices (multiplied each outcome by its probability, weighted average)

### What does this have to do with stocks?

Just like how we came up with a distribution of values of the die at the end of the die roll, we can come up with a distribution of prices of a stock on the day of an option's expiration!

We'll skip over some of the technical detail on how exactly we're going to simulate a stock price series, but you can look up Wiener Process to find out more
